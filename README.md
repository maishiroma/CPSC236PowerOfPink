# Overview
- This game was part of the many projects that we needed to do for our three week long assignments. The theme was a 2D infinite runner, done in either Unity or MonoGame. 

# Collaborators
- Matthew Shiroma
- Kevin Lin

## Goal
- Collect coins as you jump over obstacles and enemies. If you get hit once or fall off, you lose.

## Mechanics
- Jump/double jump over obstacles
- Shoot a star to destroy any enemy in front of the player.

## Obstacles
- Enemies
- Bottomless pits

## Scrapped Ideas
- Sliding under obstacles (not enough time to implement during assignment)
- Using springs to launch yourself further (not enough time to implement during assignment)

### Note
- All characters used are ripped straight from their respective sources. We did this due to time constraints, and take no credit in making them.
